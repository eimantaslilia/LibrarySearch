# LibrarySearch

The main program has a library of 5 books in it. Once the program is run, the user is asked to enter a search term. If the term is 
found either in the title or the publisher's name, the book is printed out. 

Example:

Enter your search term:  
     HoUsE  
Slaughterhouse-Five, Delacorte, 1969  
The Death of Ivan Ilyich, Penguin Random House, 2008

The class Book is there to create new objects(books) that have a title, a publisher, and publication date.  
The class Library is to store the Books in an ArrayList.  
The class StringUtils helps us search better by ignoring upper and lower cases, as well as whitespaces.
